## Project Overview
- *IC-3* is a compact, portable, and cost-effective smart device designed to monitor heart health and detect potential cardiac issues.
- It integrates **ECG monitoring, pulse rate, and blood oxygen level** measurements into a single device, leveraging AI and algorithms for health analysis and providing accessible data visualization through our web application.

## Features

### ECG, Heart rate, and SpO2 Measurement.
- ECG and HR measurement using the *uECG sensor*
- Sp02 using the *max30102 sensor*

### Heart Condition Analysis
- AI-Powered Analysis detects abnormalities related to *Atrial Fibrillation (AF)*.

- Features a compact design with a **built in rechargable battery**.
- Data visualization on our intuitive web application.
- **Touch Screen** for easy interaction on machine.
- Additional face buttons and vibration motor for physical feedback

## Technical Specifications
- Microcontroller: TTGO ESP32 S3 with integrated Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
- Sensors: Max30102 for SpO2 and pulse rate.
- uECG sensor for ECG readings.
- AI Algorithms: Developed using Python and scikit-learn.
- Cloud Integration: Firebase for data storage and web app connectivity.
- Battery Life: Over 15 hours of continuous usage. (Sensor)

## Installation
- Download and compile the code using either Arduino IDE or PlatformIO (recommended).
> The program is intended to be ran on an ESP32-S3 or ESP32-Wroom 32.
**This program will not function properly on boards without a touchscreen** 
(TTGO S3 Touch Screen version is recomended.)
